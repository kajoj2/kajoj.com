## Hello In first 2021 post! 

Before I start with meat (technical posts) I want to share my goals this will be part of a not technical post, but I want to share some of my life.

### Why to plan? 

I heard somewhere on the internet: “If you don’t realize your own goals you realize the goals of someone else.” and for me is 100% true. 

Why?

Because without a plan I can spend the whole day doing some useless things watching YouTube or playing games BTW. Cyberpunk is awesome, but I am happy that I finished it (I spend too much time on it). 
If I have the task list I know what to do, and is easier for me to focus on the task. **There is no magic that magically boosts my motivation to do  task from this list.** I must force myself to do things instead of chilling with Netflix, but it is easier if you know what to do.

This was about tasks which are short like: 
- Buy milk
- Call to Tim
- Update company site (Add new crewmate)
- Write a blog post about my goals 

Goals are usual bigger things like:
- run a marathon 
- start own company and achieve 100k$ income
- do 5 pull-ups
- get 100k views on the blog 
- record 5 videos on YouTube

So why I wrote about tasks, not about goals? 
The answer is pretty simple all goals you can split into too many tasks. In another word based on your long term goal you can create your short term task and by doing it you can achieve your big goals.

**It sounds simple because it is not that hard, the hardest thing is to do it not wait for magic motivation, Just do it!**


It's 19 days after I start writing this... I think I should have precise these goals faster but "studying for exams" is the perfect excuse 🙄

I personally tread these goals as things that I want to focus not as things which I must do everything to achieve  them


## Show me the goals!

So my goals/focus list looks like this:

- Finish this page 
- Build an embedded Linux board
- Make 100 push-ups 
- Pass exams in studies. 
- Get more work experience on AWS and C# 
- Go on holiday (a couple of days in some hotel)
- Write 10 post on the blog 
- Make 5 videos on YouTube(or other video platforms)

I also want to create a separate page with my goals (not only for 2021)
